        h3 Cutting edge coworking in South Carolina?
        p The place you live in tells a story and we like the story that Upstate SC tells. Certainly, every member of CoWork, at some point, has lived in or toyed with the idea of the “big city.” But we thrive on the small-town aesthetic of our area, the cultivated local art scenes, and quality people just like ourselves. Come take a look for yourself.
        p Our Coworking spaces are comprised of designers, strategists, developers, writers and entrepreneurs. We’re not talking about fly-by-night freelancers. They’re independent business owners, connected with each other through the space they share and the projects they inevitably develop together.
