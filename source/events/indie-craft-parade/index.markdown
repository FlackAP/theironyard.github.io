### Skilled artisans have redefined Americaâ€™s craft scene.

### Our Vision

In a public market that promotes quality crafts, Indie Craft Parade brings together the best artists in the Southeast and encourages interaction between the community and local independent artists.

Each year talented musicians and local food vendors are also invited to contribute to the vibrant atmosphere of the festivities.
