  <div class="graduates-right">
    <h1 class="name">Peter Barth</h1>
    <p class="bio">Peter went to Vanderbilt University where he studied computer engineering, which naturally led to him becoming an options executive on Wall Street. After the financial markets had worn their welcome, he packed his family up, moved to Indianapolis and returned to his hacker roots as a software developer and CTO for SinglePoint, Inc. After several other successful software exits, he moved his family again, but this time to Greenville, SC where he help start NEXT, build the NEXT Innovation Center and founded The Iron Yard. He currently serves as our CEO and is sometimes referred to as &#8220;The Iron Barth.&#8221;</p>

  <div class="graduates-right">
    <h1 class="name">Eric Dodds</h1>
    <p class="bio">Eric was born and raised in Upstate, SC where he spent his early year hiking, mountain biking and dirt bike riding with his dad. Somehow he ended up at Clemson University where he tutored calculus, studied marketing and matriculated summa cum laude. (We hear there was a lot of wake boarding, too.) After school Eric worked at a nationally renowned marketing shop where he developed content, managed accounts and built strategies for companies like Best Buy and Double Day. He crossed paths with Peter as The Iron Yard was being born and jumped ship to join as a partner and head of marketing.</p>

  <div class="graduates-right">
    <h1 class="name">Mason Stewart</h1>
    <p class="bio">Mason was born and raised in Jackson, Mississippi (better known as The Dirty South). He grew up in the woods and, as a result, likes animals, trees and beer. A hacker from the start, he began hacking on software in his early teens. Upon moving back to the USA after four years in Japan, at age 24 he ended a multi-year fast from programming and hit the ground running. Like any good college graduate with a degree in philosophy, he&#8217;s worked for small, boutique web shops, startups in San Francisco, and everywhere in between. Mason serves as our CTO and head of all things pedagogical. </p>

    <p class="bio">Marty is not your typical Managing Director. For a guy that used to be 300lbs and made crying babies of Division I Defensive Linemen, he is a gentle hearted husband to his wife, Sarah, father to his pooch, Shakey, fearless leader of the startup company Ridepost. His super-human abilities allow him to also serve as the head of all things Accelerator at The Iron Yard. He is learning the art of the home brew, is an avid fly-fisherman and bounces between angling Largemouth Bass and Largewallet Investors.</p>

Post cap-and-gown, Kate moved to Toronto and worked on the social media team at Lululemon Athletica, which led to starting her own online marketing consultancy. She took a break to do a year of service at Habitat for Humanity, which led her to the Carolinas and The Iron Yard, where she serves as our Program and Community Director for our Accelerators. </p>

    <p class="bio">Nick viciously pursued a degree in Video Game Development from Full Sail where he received his bachelors in 2 years. He has since switched industries and started developing web applications&#8230;and he hasn&#8217;t looked back. He moved to Charleston, SC where he began consuming every bit of knowledge he could. While moving up the ranks at Jack Russell Software to become a Senior Developer (from apprentice in only 3.5 years!), he found a love for teaching motivated individuals everything he had to offer and decided to pursue a career in education. He is super excited to teach and share his passion for his craft (web applications) to students at The Iron Yard Academy.</p>
