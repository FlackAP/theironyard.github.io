<p>We&rsquo;re a southern ignition of entrepreneurs, investors, developers, artists, teachers, collaborative spaces, and the events that bring them all together. We believe that quality people are the secret to innovation and inspiration and that we&rsquo;re at our best when we work together.</p>

<h2>We live, work, and play in wonderful cities <a href="/locations">across the Southeast</a>.</h2>

<h3>Who We Are</h3>

<p><img src="/images/about/eric-dodds.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 0px 18px 0px 0px; display: inline-block; border-radius: 3px;"></p>

<h4>Eric Dodds<br><em>Managing Director</em></h4>

<p>Eric was born and raised in the Upstate (that’s SC for all you Yanks out there), where he spent his early years hiking, mountain biking and dirt bike riding with his dad. Somehow or other he ended up at Clemson University, and the result was a degree in marketing, some tutoring in calculus, a lot of wakeboarding and a proudly matriculated summa cum laude.</p>

<p>After school Eric took a marketing internship at Brains on Fire, where he worked his way from research assistant to full blown account manager and strategist. He has executed successful projects for Best Buy, Doubleday Publishing, Colonial Williamsburg, and Liquid Wrench. Even though he liked his day job, nights and weekends often found Eric scheming up new ideas and companies with developer friends.</p>

<p>Luckily he crossed paths with Peter and Matthew just as the idea for The Iron Yard was born, and he jumped ship to join their crew as a partner and producer. Day to day you&rsquo;ll see him tackle everything from accounting to coding, making sure the team is having fun and projects are getting done.</p>

<p>When he&rsquo;s not knee-deep in startup world, you can probably find him hiking or biking in the woods, building something in his shop, or on a walk with his wife.</p>

<h4>Mason Stewart<br><em>Technical Director</em></h4>

<p>Mason was born and raised in Jackson, Mississippi, better known as the Dirty South. He grew up in the woods and likes animals, trees, and beer. Upon moving back to the USA after four years in Japan, at age 24 he ended a multi-year fast from programming and hit the ground running. Like any good college graduate with a degree in philosophy, Mason is a front-end engineer and a JavaScript guy, but &ldquo;after hours&rdquo; he loves programming in Lisp.</p>

<p> In addition to teaching kids, he has worked for small, Southern boutique web shops, startups from San Francisco to Greenville, and everywhere in between. Mason now directs the Iron Yard Academy, which encompasses CoderDojo and the Iron Yard&rsquo;s Intensive School. He also spends his days hacking on the Iron Yard&rsquo;s chatbot, teaching it to surprise the other Iron Yarders with memes and gifs.</p>

<p>A decent mixologist, and no mean hand at Japanese cooking, his preferred pastimes are kicking it with friends and family, crafting tasty beverages, gardening, and slow-roasting anything he can get his hands on.</p>

<h4>Peter Barth<br><em>Executive Director</em></h4>

<p>Peter went to Vanderbilt University, where he studied computer engineering. After school he did what all engineers do: moved to Manhattan to become an options and securities principal at Duke &amp; Company (and later Morgan Stanley). Minting deals and moving stock was fun, but a few years on Wall Street reminded Pete he was a hacker at heart.</p>

<p>He packed up his computer and family and headed to Indianapolis to develop software for SinglePoint, an enterprise payroll service. With hard work and technical expertise, he worked his way up to CTO and purchased a stake in the business. In 2006, Peter moved his family again, but this time to sunny South Carolina. In Greenville, Peter has taken leadership roles in the development of NEXT, the NEXT Innovation Center, InternGreenville, and the southeast&rsquo;s premier startup accelerator, The Iron Yard.</p>

<p>Peter married his college sweetheart and has five incredible kids. In the rare times he&rsquo;s not at work or with his family, you can find him heads down in the latest fantasy or science fiction novel.</p>

<h4>Kate McCarthy<br><em>Digital Health Director</em></h4>

<p>Kate was born and raised in Pasadena, CA but traded sunglasses for snowshoes at McGill University in Montreal. It only took her three years to get two degrees (Cultural Studies and Art History), and she even had time to build a small cupcake business.</p>

<p>Post cap-and gown, Kate moved to Toronto to join the social media team at Lululemon Athletica, where she soaked in all she could before heading back to LA and starting her own consulting company. Eventually she went in-house with one of her clients, where she got a crash course in marketing and business operations. Kate felt moved to pursue a year of service, so she bought a truck, drove across the country, and spent a year swinging hammers at Habitat for Humanity. After completing her service, Kate headed to the Upstate to work as a community manager and strategist at Brains on Fire.</p>

<p>Turns out, Kate’s a southern gal at heart. She’s thrilled to combine her passion for community development and knack for marketing and relationship building at The Iron Yard.</p>
